# Project Update Watcher

This is a system of reporting about outdated composer dependencies that are used in a project.
Originally, it was designed to be used on Magento 2 based projects 
where custom modules are frequently installed via Composer.
However, the idea is platform-agnostic.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.1
- CRON
- Sendmail
- GIT
